    <h2>A Brief Introduction.....</h2>
        <p>My name is Dean and I live and work in Bristol. By day I am a First Line Service Desk Engineer but by night I am Karateka, Comptia a+ student, guitar player and song writer and Web Development Novice with a desire to make really cool websites for all my different hobies! I also have a black belt in Aikido and practiced BJJ for around 4 years.
        <p>I live with my Fiance Sarah and my cat Humphrey near the centre of Bristol. I am a Bristolian - tried but failed to leave on many occassions but loving life and looking forward to making my on-line presence in the future by learning lots of exciting new tech!</p>
        <p>Please, read on......</p>
        </p>


<ul>
    <li><h3>Education</h3> </li>  

    

        <p>I love learning. I'm currently studying for a Web Development Bootcamp with the App Brewery via Udemy, studying for Comptia a+ both Core 1 and Core 2 and only recently completed a Certificate in Spanish and German via the Open University which I started during the pandemic and finished last year</p>
        <p>It was hard, it was difficult, it took over my life but it improved me as a person: I became disciplined, better at learning and appreciative of how I learn (I'm a visual learner by the way).</p>

    <li><h3>My Career Experience</h3></li>

    

        <p>I've done lots of different jobs in my time. I worked in law as a Litigator for many years but the industry I worked in (RTA Personal Injury) has died a death after many years of cost cutting. You might be familiar with "have you had an accident that wasn't your fault in the last three years?" Yes - I was the one who ran the claims. Soulness, poor in both financial and persoal reward. Something I am very glad to be shot of as it were.</p>
        <p>I then moved onto recruitment as I enjoyed targets and was always the top biller in my paralegal days. I enjoyed the work, had lots of promotions but a combination of the pandemic and the Covid Pandemic put paid to that</p>
        <p>And that brings us to today: now I am a Service Desk Engineer combining my excitement at fixing problems helping people and knowing that my career is pretty stable (let's hope I'm not updating this resume with a reference to a robot stealing my job in the next few years! Fingers crossed!)</p>

<li><h3>What I Can Do</h3></li>

    <p>So, what skills have I learnt from my career? I can sell, I can talk, I can provide great customer service, 
        draft legal proceedings and run a case to court and am not too bad at fixing IT issues of end users. 
        Hopefully I won't be replaced by a robot in the future!</p>
